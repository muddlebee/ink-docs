# Notifications

`useink/notifications` is an extension of `useink` that provides an opinionated state management
system for tracking the changing states of a transaction. When you add a notification it will
live until the configured time to live has expired then will automatically be removed from state. This
is useful for temporarily displaying a notification then having it removed in the view.
`useink/notifications` does not contain any UI elements. It only tracks state. You can use this in
combination with UI libraries or components of your choice.

## Installation

You must first [install useink](/frontend/getting-started#installation). `useink/notifications` has
its own import path in the

## Wrap your application with NotificationsProvider

Notification state management is not in useink by default. You must wrap your application with `<NotificationsProvider>`.

```ts
import { NotificationsProvider } from 'useink/notifications'

function App({ children }) {
  return (
    <NotificationsProvider>
      <MyRoutes />
    </NotificationsProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```
